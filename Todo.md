# Todo

1. [x] Replace usage of linux-syscalls and delete it
2. [x] Fixup start
3. [x] Fix signal handling
4. [ ] Should probably use signalfd instead for less wild unsafety
5. [ ] Generate and sort raw types directly from kernel code
6. [x] Figure out VDSO
7. [ ] Get a real mutex
8. [ ] Feature gate things even harder in both [rusl](rusl) and [tiny-std](tiny-std)
